        <h2>üìú Bio</h2>
          <p>
            First of all there is nothing much to say about me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a junior student of Inha University in Tashkent. Before Uni I was very interested in science and problem solving, hence I thought computer science would be a good challenge. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I haven't took on many jobs. I tried myself in teaching and translation, but something was still lacking. So I decided to go with programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently I am looking for a job, so if you need a web developer, contact me.
          </p>
